;; TEMPORARY AREA
;;
;; Real test hardware has had zx next instructions removed
;; as many have smaller fpgas that cannot hold all the logic.
;;
;; Must translate "nextreg" and "mmu" instructions we are
;; using to actual OUTs.  This also affects the C macros
;; used to inline these instructions in zxn.h because zsdcc
;; is being told which registers are unaffected by the macros.
;;
;; This rules file only affects c code.
