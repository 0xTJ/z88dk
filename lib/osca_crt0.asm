;       EXTRA OPTIONS:
;
;		At C source level:
;       #pragma output osca_bank=(0..14) set the memory bank for locations > 32768 before loading program
;		#pragma output osca_stack=<value> put the stack in a differen place, i.e. 32767
;
;       At compile time:
;		-zorg=<location> parameter permits to specify the program position
