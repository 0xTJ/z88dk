[
* pattern filler
  add shaped fill

* output terminal
  add inverse, underline, italic, xor, or
]

* fzx output terminal

* target open

* zx scroll reexamined

* text mode open on memstreams

* known issue: input terminals immediately repeat key on caps/lower transition

* REGISTER_SP = -1 should denote the do not alter sp condition

* all struct offsets in asm code should be defined in a DEFVARS block

* replace "ld rl,ixl; ld rh,ixh" pairs with "push ix; pop rp"
saves a byte and extra speed rarely necessary

* asm_fzx_putc (zx) -- move attr colouring to draw subroutines to only colour portions with drawn pixels??

* update header files

* remove fzx cpl mode -- cannot easily be done
