TODO:

[

* text mode open on memstreams

* do we really need two sets of input/output primitives for stdio

* known issue: input terminals immediately repeat key on caps/lower transition

* known issue: fzx justify functions need to distribute remainder spacing evenly

* known issue: in password mode output terminals display '*' when enter typed

* known issue: fzx output terminal scroll limit seems off

* zx scroll reexamined

* change 4x8 font to use only nibbles in definition


MEDIUM TERM:

* add library options to opt in/out of ioctls

* make some library options compile time rather than library build time



LONG TERM:

* all struct offsets in asm code should be defined in a DEFVARS block

* low level fzx print functions with embedded sequences



LONG TERM TENTATIVE:

* pattern filler
  add shaped fill

* output terminal
  add inverse, underline, italic, xor, or


]

* target open

* generate fresh crts for spectrum target

* EXTERN reference for PUBLIC definition in same file generates error

* check constraints on code location in some stdio state machines

* create library functions to load from fixed offset from ix
should save dozens of bytes
