[
* pattern filler
  add shaped fill

* output terminal
  add inverse, underline, italic, xor, or
  
* text mode open on memstreams

* all struct offsets in asm code should be defined in a DEFVARS block
]

* fzx output terminal

* target open

* zx scroll reexamined

* known issue: input terminals immediately repeat key on caps/lower transition

* replace "ld rl,ixl; ld rh,ixh" pairs with "push ix; pop rp"
saves a byte and extra speed rarely necessary

* asm_fzx_putc (zx) -- colour maximum rectangle around char

* change 4x8 font to use only nibbles in definition

* known issue: fzx justify functions need to distribute remainder spacing evenly

* fzx print functions with embedded sequences

* generate fresh crts for spectrum if2 target

* check constraints on code location in some stdio state machines

* add fast memcpy,etc selection to crt_cfg

* move memory map to target directories
