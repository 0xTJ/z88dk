BLOCK DEVICE DRIVER

These are base classes to assist in implementing device drivers
for block devices.  Block devices are devices which do i/o in
units of records.  Records can be of any size convenient for
the specific device.  Common sizes are 128/256/512 bytes for
floppy disk and 512/1024 bytes for hard disk.

These base classes convert character oriented stream i/o as
generated by the clib into block oriented messages to ease
implementation of a specific device driver.  A buffering
strategy is provided to allow whole records to be kept in
memory for character-at-a-time consumption by the clib.

The intention is that all block devices share the same implementation
code (this set of base classes) and the code specializing for a
specific device is small and only needs to implement a few simple
requests.

The block device drivers are divided into different levels.
Each level offers different feature/size compromises.  All levels
are available to each target machine and the intention is the user
can choose what feature set he needs for his program by selecting
the appropriate level at compile time.


* Level 0



* Level 1
