BLOCK DEVICE DRIVER

These are base classes to assist in implementing device drivers
for block devices.  Block devices are devices which do i/o in
units of records.  Records can be of any size convenient for
the specific device.  Common sizes are 128/256/512 bytes for
floppy disk and 512/1024 bytes for hard disk.

These base classes convert character oriented stream i/o as
generated by the clib into block oriented messages to ease
implementation of a specific device driver.  A buffering
strategy is provided to allow whole records to be kept in
memory for character-at-a-time consumption by the clib.

The intention is that all block devices share the same implementation
code (this set of base classes) and the code specializing for a
specific device is small and only needs to implement a few simple
requests.
