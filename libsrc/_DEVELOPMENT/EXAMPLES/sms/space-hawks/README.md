Space Hawks

This game is the unofficial port of the Amstrad game to the Sega Master System.
I built it for the SMS Power! devkitSMS Coding Competition 2016.
Final ROM is 32kb, with 14kb from the assets.

It's my first try on SMS, while I develop for 15years on Genesis.
I learnt a lot on this one and fixed my bad knowledge on the VDP, thank to sverx and SMSPower members.

To build it from source, see the readme.build
Please note that I was unable to fix, for now, the glitch which occurs on some sprites while playing.
Competition deadline is coming, so I'll fix it later, I hope.


Special thanks to sverx, ichigo and Maxim
