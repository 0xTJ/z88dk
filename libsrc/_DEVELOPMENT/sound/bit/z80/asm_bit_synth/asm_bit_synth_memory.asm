   ; quad synthesizer outputting to memory mapped 1-bit device
   ; included into "sound/bit/z80/asm_bit_synth.asm"

   ; This is a sort of "quad sound" routine.  It is based on four
   ; separate counters and a delay.  Depending on the parameters
   ; being passed, it is able to play using two audible voices,
   ; to generate sound effects and to play with a single voice
   ; having odd waveforms.
   ;
   ; Unfortunately self-modifying code is used to store parameters.
   ; This routine shouldn't stay in contended memory locations !!
