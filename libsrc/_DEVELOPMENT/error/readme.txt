ERROR
=====

Exit points from subroutines.

These functions are meant as a convenient exit from a function.

Exit functions terminating in "_zc", "_znc", "_mc", "_mnc" set
the HL register to be zero or minus one and the carry flag to
the state indicated.

Exit functions containing a standard C errno name as in "_einval_"
also set the thread's errno to the error indicated.

All exit functions allow the stack to be adjusted by a known
number of pops by jumping to their entry points minus the number
of pops desired.

So, eg, a jump to "error_einval_zc - 2" will pop two items off
the stack, set errno equal to EINVAL and return to the caller
with HL=0 and carry flag set.

Before performing such a pop-jump, examine the source code to
ensure that the exit function has enough pops prior to its entry
point. Most will have 1-3 pops available.
