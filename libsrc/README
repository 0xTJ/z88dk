To rebuild the libraries in full do the following:

% make clean
% make
% make install

And tada, new libraries for you, if you just want to rebuild a specific
library, eg malloc.lib then do a:

% make clean
% make malloc.lib

And copy it over to the clibs directory...hey, makefiles are great!!!

I've split up the crt0 routines (fetch int etc) from the clib because I was
sick of constantly recompiling those things!! This also lends itself to
a certain degree of machine abstraction

This directory has been rearranged, machine specific routines for each
directory are now placed in subdirs below the appropriate directory -
this gives some sort of a clue as to what is needed for ports to
different machines
