/*
* $Log: exprprsr.c,v $
* Revision 1.86  2014-06-30 22:29:36  pauloscustodio
* Separate expression type from expression range - new range_t enum
* type for ranges and new range attribute in Expr.
*
* Revision 1.85  2014/06/09 13:15:26  pauloscustodio
* Int and UInt types
*
* Revision 1.84  2014/06/02 22:29:13  pauloscustodio
* Write object file in one go at the end of pass 2, instead of writing
* parts during pass 1 assembly. This allows the object file format to be
* changed more easily, to allow sections in a near future.
* Remove global variable objfile and CloseFiles().
*
* Revision 1.83  2014/06/01 22:16:50  pauloscustodio
* Write expressions to object file only in pass 2, to remove dupplicate code
* and allow simplification of object file writing code. All expression
* error messages are now output only during pass 2.
*
* Revision 1.82  2014/05/29 00:19:37  pauloscustodio
* CH_0025: Link-time expression evaluation errors show source filename and line number
* Object file format changed to version 04, to include the source file
* location of expressions in order to give meaningful link-time error messages.
*
* Revision 1.81  2014/05/25 01:02:29  pauloscustodio
* Byte, Int, UInt added
*
* Revision 1.80  2014/05/17 14:27:12  pauloscustodio
* Use C99 integer types
*
* Revision 1.79  2014/05/06 22:52:01  pauloscustodio
* Remove OS-dependent defines and dependency on ../config.h.
* Remove OS_ID constant from predefined defines in assembly.
*
* Revision 1.78  2014/05/06 22:17:37  pauloscustodio
* Made types all-caps to avoid conflicts with /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/sys/types.h
*
* Revision 1.77  2014/05/02 21:34:58  pauloscustodio
* byte_t and uint_t renamed to Byte, UInt
*
* Revision 1.76  2014/05/02 20:24:38  pauloscustodio
* New class Module to replace struct module and struct modules
*
* Revision 1.75  2014/04/22 23:32:42  pauloscustodio
* Release 2.2.0 with major fixes:
*
* - Object file format changed to version 03, to include address of start
* of the opcode of each expression stored in the object file, to allow
* ASMPC to refer to the start of the opcode instead of the patch pointer.
* This solves long standing BUG_0011 and BUG_0048.
*
* - ASMPC no longer stored in the symbol table and evaluated as a separate
* token, to allow expressions including ASMPC to be relocated. This solves
* long standing and never detected BUG_0047.
*
* - Handling ASMPC during assembly simplified - no need to call inc_PC() on
* every assembled instruction, no need to store list of JRPC addresses as
* ASMPC is now stored in the expression.
*
* BUG_0047: Expressions including ASMPC not relocated - impacts call po|pe|p|m emulation in RCMX000
* ASMPC is computed on zero-base address of the code section and expressions
* including ASMPC are not relocated at link time.
* "call po, xx" is emulated in --RCMX000 as "jp pe, ASMPC+3; call xx".
* The expression ASMPC+3 is not marked as relocateable, and the resulting
* code only works when linked at address 0.
*
* BUG_0048: ASMPC used in JP/CALL argument does not refer to start of statement
* In "JP ASMPC", ASMPC is coded as instruction-address + 1 instead
* of instruction-address.
*
* BUG_0011 : ASMPC should refer to start of statememnt, not current element in DEFB/DEFW
* Bug only happens with forward references to relative addresses in expressions.
* See example from zx48.asm ROM image in t/BUG_0011.t test file.
* Need to change object file format to correct - need patchptr and address of instruction start.
*
* Revision 1.74  2014/04/18 17:46:18  pauloscustodio
* - Change struct expr to Expr class, use CLASS_LIST instead of linked list
*   manipulating.
* - Factor parsing and evaluating contants.
* - Factor symbol-not-defined error during expression evaluation.
* - Store module name in strpool instead of xstrdup/xfree.
*

* ident[] replaced by tok_name.
*
* Revision 1.70  2014/03/16 19:19:49  pauloscustodio
* Integrate use of srcfile in scanner, removing global variable z80asmfile
* and attributes CURRENTMODULE->cfile->line and CURRENTMODULE->cfile->fname.

* Remove check for feof(z80asmfile), add token TK_END to return on EOF.
* Allows decoupling of input file used in scanner from callers.
* Removed TOTALLINES.
* GetChar() made static to scanner, not called by other modules.
*
* Revision 1.67  2014/03/11 00:15:13  pauloscustodio
* Scanner reads input line-by-line instead of character-by-character.
* Factor house-keeping at each new line read in the scanner getasmline().
* Add interface to allow back-tacking of the recursive descent parser by
* getting the current input buffer position and comming back to the same later.
* SetTemporaryLine() keeps a stack of previous input lines.
* Scanner handles single-quoted strings and returns a number.
* New error for single-quoted string with length != 1.
* Scanner handles double-quoted strings and returns the quoted string.
*
* Revision 1.66  2014/03/06 00:18:43  pauloscustodio
* BUG_0043: buffer overflow on constants longer than 128 chars in object file
* z80asm crashed when the expression to be stored in the obejct file was
* longer than the maximum allocated size (128). Changed to dynamic string.
*
* Revision 1.64  2014/03/04 11:49:47  pauloscustodio
* Expression parser and expression evaluator use a look-up table of all
* supported unary, binary and ternary oprators, instead of a big switch
* statement to select the operation.
* Expression operations are stored in a contiguous array instead of
* a liked list to reduce administrative overhead of adding / iterating.
*
* Revision 1.63  2014/03/03 14:09:20  pauloscustodio
* Renamed symbol type attribute
*
* Revision 1.62  2014/03/03 13:43:50  pauloscustodio

* Division by zero error was causing memory leaks - made non-fatal.
* Moved calculator stack to expr.c, made it singleton and based on array.h - no
* need to allocate on every expression computed, elements are stored in
* a vector instead of being allocated individually.
*
* Revision 1.59  2014/03/02 12:51:41  pauloscustodio

* Revision 1.54  2014/02/19 23:59:26  pauloscustodio
* BUG_0042: 64-bit portability issues
* size_t changes to unsigned long in 64-bit. Usage of size_t * to
* retrieve unsigned integers from an open file by fileutil's xfget_uintxx()
* breaks on a 64-bit architecture. Make the functions return the value instead
* of being passed the pointer to the return value, so that the compiler
* takes care of size convertions.
* Create UInt, use UInt instead of size_t.

* - Replaced e4c exception mechanism by a much simpler one based on a few
*   macros. The former did not allow an exit(1) to be called within a
*   try-catch block.
*
* Revision 1.40  2013/08/30 21:50:43  pauloscustodio
* By suggestion of Philipp Klaus Krause: rename LEGACY to __LEGACY_Z80ASM_SYNTAX,
* as an identifier reserved by the C standard for implementation-defined behaviour
* starting with two underscores.
*
* Revision 1.39  2013/08/30 01:06:08  pauloscustodio
* New C-like expressions, defined when __LEGACY_Z80ASM_SYNTAX is not defined. Keeps old

*   "Z80RMF02", "Z80LMF02", to avoid usage of old
*   object files with expressions inside in the old format
*
* Detail:
* - String concatenation in DEFM: changed from '&' to ',';  '&' will be AND
* - Power:                        changed from '^' to '**'; '^' will be XOR
* - XOR:                          changed from ':' to '^';
* - AND:                          changed from '~' to '&';  '~' will be NOT
* - NOT:                          '~' added as binary not

* Revision 1.20  2011/10/07 17:53:04  pauloscustodio
* BUG_0015 : Relocation issue - dubious addresses come out of linking
* (reported on Tue, Sep 27, 2011 at 8:09 PM by dom)
* - Introduced in version 1.1.8, when the CODESIZE and the codeptr were merged into the same entity.
* - This caused the problem because CODESIZE keeps track of the start offset of each module in the sequence they will appear in the object file, and codeptr is reset to the start of the codearea for each module.
* The effect was that all address calculations at link phase were considering
*  a start offset of zero for all modules.
* - Moreover, when linking modules from a libary, the modules are pulled in to the code area as they are needed, and not in the sequence they will be in the object file. The start offset was being ignored and the modules were being loaded in the incorrect order
* - Consequence of these two issues were all linked addresses wrong.
*
* Revision 1.19  2011/08/19 15:53:58  pauloscustodio
* BUG_0010 : heap corruption when reaching MAXCODESIZE
* - test for overflow of MAXCODESIZE is done before each instruction at parseline(); 
*	if only one byte is available in codearea, and a 2 byte instruction is assembled, 
*	the heap is corrupted before the exception is raised.
* - Factored all the codearea-accessing code into a new module, checking for MAXCODESIZE on every write.
*
* Revision 1.18  2011/08/18 23:27:54  pauloscustodio
* BUG_0009 : file read/write not tested for errors
* - In case of disk full file write fails, but assembler does not detect the error
*   and leaves back corruped object/binary files
* - Created new exception FileIOException and ERR_FILE_IO error.
* - Created new functions xfput_u8, xfget_u8, ... to raise the exception on error.
*
* Revision 1.17  2011/08/15 17:12:31  pauloscustodio
* Upgrade to Exceptions4c 2.8.9 to solve memory leak.
*
* Revision 1.16  2011/08/05 19:46:16  pauloscustodio
* CH_0004 : Exception mechanism to handle fatal errors
* Replaced all ERR_NO_MEMORY/return sequences by an exception, captured at main().
* Replaced all the memory allocation functions malloc, calloc, ... by corresponding
* macros xmalloc, xcalloc, ... that raise an exception if the memory cannot be allocated,
* removing all the test code after each memory allocation.
* Replaced all functions that allocated memory structures by the new xcalloc_struct().
* Replaced all free() by xfree0() macro which only frees if the pointer in non-null, and
* sets the poiter to NULL afterwards, to avoid any used of the freed memory.
* Created try/catch sequences to clean-up partially created memory structures and rethrow the
* exception, to cleanup memory leaks.
*
* Revision 1.15  2011/07/18 00:48:25  pauloscustodio
* Initialize MS Visual Studio DEBUG build to show memory leaks on exit
*
* Revision 1.14  2011/07/14 01:28:17  pauloscustodio
*     BUG_0006 : sub-expressions with unbalanced parentheses type accepted, e.g. (2+3] or [2+3)
*         - Raise ERR_UNBALANCED_PAREN instead
*     CH_0003 : Error messages should be more informative
*         - Added printf-args to error messages, added "Error:" prefix.
*

* BUG_0004 : 8bit unsigned constants are not checked for out-of-range
*      Added the check to ExprUnsigned8() and Z80pass2().
* BUG_0005 : Offset of (ix+d) should be optional; '+' or '-' are necessary
*      ExprSigned8(): Accept (ix) and (iy), use offset zero.
*      Raise syntax error for (ix 4), was accepting as (ix+4).
* CH_0002 : Unary plus and unary minus added to Factor()
*      Accept unary minus and unary plus in factor to allow (ix+ -3) to be
*      parsed as (ix-3).
*
* Revision 1.7  2010/09/19 00:06:20  dom
* Tweaks for compiling code generated by sdcc - it generates XREF rather than
* LIB so treat XREF as a LIB (this possibly should be the default)
*
* Do some _ mapping magic when in sdcc so standard z88dk libs can be used
* (wrong _ convention chosen a long time ago...)
*
* Have -forcexlib flag which treats MODULE as XLIB.
*
* Revision 1.6  2010/04/16 17:34:37  dom
* Make line number an int - 32768 lines isn't big enough...
