The new default for startup creates automatically a valid "vz" file
with BASIC loader included; use the old way for graphics applications.

How pass the code to the VZ emulator.

- Get the VZ emulator from:
  http://www.powerup.com.au/~intertek/VZ200/vz.htm
- Get the utilities, also
- Set the environment variables correctly
- Compile your code (to a.bin)  NOTE THAT THE "-startup=2" PARAMETER IS REQUIRED
- Use the rbinary utility (Rbinary.exe a.bin a.vz)
- Run the emulator
- Type: POKE 30862,0:POKE 30863,128
- Press F10, then 1 (Load Program)
- Chose a.vz
- Return to the emulator (press ENTER)
- Type: X=USR(0)

Enjoy it !

The most difficult thing is to "understand" the VZ keyboard;
only the left SHIFT key works.
It is also possible to create a .WAV file for passing the program on tape.

If you're going to run graphics type in a small BASIC program like this:
10 MODE (1)
20 X = USR (0)

After executing the program BASIC goes back to text mode.
