The Jupiter ACE has a built-in FORTH interpreter in ROM (no BASIC, here!)
There is very little software for it;  maybe the Z88DK will help !

FORTH command syntax:
s l bsave <name> saves l bytes from the memory starting at address s as <name> 
s l bload <name> loades l bytes to the memory starting at address s as <name>. If s or l is zero will their value be taken from the file. 
addr call will call Z80 machine code at addr, should be terminated with a jp (iy) Z80 instruction. 


So:

- compile the program:				zcc +ace program.c
- convert it:					bin2byt a.bas program.byt
- run the emulator				vace
- from within the emulator, load the program:	16384 40000 bload
- run the thing:				16384 call


Have fun !
