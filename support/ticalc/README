The batch files are the OLD conversion tools; they use conversion utilities that 
can be found on ticalc.org
When possible use bin2var: a single utility covers all the TI calculators.


TI82: CrASH shell SDK suggested (http://www.lfx.org/crashware/ or http://www.ticalc.org)
zcc82.bat - uses the CRPRGM82.EXE command (included with the shell).


TI83: All the Shells ! (http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83/asm/shells)
	Change the -startup flag at compile time (see TI83_CRT0.ASM)
	ION Shell is used by default, now.
zcc83.bat - uses the debug command as a workaround for problems with DEVPAC83.COM and WIN2000/NT.
	Probably UNICODE is a problem for the parameter parser; this should FIX.
	Such FIX isn't necessary for MS DOS - Win 95/98/ME, but should work.


TI83 plus: Tested under the ION SHELL (http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/asm/shells/ion.zip).
zcc83p.bat - as for the TI83, but changes the file extention to .8xp.


TI85: We heavily changed the binary structure, recently !!
Please note that the "STRING85" utility can't be used anymore.
Use BIN2VAR or other generic .85s string converters; an example follows:
	- zcc +ti85ansi -lm program.c
	- bin2var a.bin program.85s


TI86
zcc86.bat - Uses prgm86.exe for the file conversion.
		If you leave the startup code unchanged (I suggest so) LASM must be used.
		get it from http://www.ticalc.org/pub/86/asm/shells/ti86no8k.zip
		this will go over the 8Kb barrier.
