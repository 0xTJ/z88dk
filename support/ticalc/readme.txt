TI82: CrASH shell SDK suggested (http://www.lfx.org/crashware/ or http://www.ticalc.org)
zcc82.bat - uses the CRPRGM82.EXE command (included with the shell).


TI83: Tested under TI-Explorer (suggested: http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83/asm/shells/explorer.zip),
	 ANOVA, SOS and ASHELL (NOT the ION SHELL!).
zcc83.bat - uses the debug command as a workaround for problems with DEVPAC83.COM and WIN2000/NT.
	Probably UNICODE is a problem for the parameter parser; this should FIX.
	Such FIX isn't necessary for MS DOS - Win 95/98/ME, but should work.


TI83 plus: Tested under the ION SHELL (http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/asm/shells/ion.zip).
zcc83p.bat - as for the TI83, but changes the file extention to .8xp.


TI85: Runs under the RIGEL shell only (http://www.ticalc.org/pub/85/asm/shells/rigel.zip).
zcc85.bat - uses STRING85.EXE, included in RIGEL, also.


TI86
zcc86.bat - Uses prgm86.exe for the file conversion.
		If you leave the startup code unchanged (I suggest so) LASM must be used.	
		get it from http://www.ticalc.org/pub/86/asm/shells/ti86no8k.zip
		this will go over the 8Kb barrier.
